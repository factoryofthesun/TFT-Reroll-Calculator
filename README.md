Last updated for patch: 10.14 

A generalized calculator that computes the probability of hitting a certain # of units under any given game state in TFT. 
Comes with expected cost comparisons between rerolling vs leveling then rerolling and counterfactual changes to the game (unit probabilities, # copies per pool, etc).
